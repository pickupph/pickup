    "title": "How far do you deliver?",
    "content": "<p>The absolute maximum delivery radiuses vary based on the logistics partner. Deliveries can be as far as 20km, but we recommend setting a delivery distance that ensures your food is never in transit for longer than it needs to be. Some cuisines travel better than others and this is something you should consider when selecting the right delivery distance. You can change your maximum delivery distance in the Delivery Settings of your Pickup App or by emailing support at support@pickup.ph. </p>",
