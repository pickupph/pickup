          <p className="text-[16px] mb-10">
            In 2020, Ingga Chua and Thomas Woudwyk, found a common pain point
            while running their pizza store during a pandemic; they were too
            busy managing the operations of their business, when all of a sudden
            customers shifted overnight from walk-in ordering to online
            ordering. Instantly, customers were placing orders via Phone,
            Google, Messenger, Instagram, Viber, Whatsapp and the team had to
            manually take all of these orders, hail delivery riders individually
            and it all became impossible to manage.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[16px] mb-10">
            That was when Pickup was born; Thomas designed Pickup to take what
            is otherwise complicated and inaccessible like online ordering,
            payments, order management and delivery, but make it simple and
            accessible to everyone. We believe that in this post-pandemic era,
            being online and able to accept commission-free direct orders from
            customers will be a basic necessity, just like having a business
            Facebook page is today.
